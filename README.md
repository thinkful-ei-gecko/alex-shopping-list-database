## Drill

Following from the previous assignment, you should already have a table called shopping_list inside your knex-practice database. Make a new file in your knex-practice project for ./src/shopping-list-service.js that contains methods for CRUD: to get, insert, update and delete shopping list items. Also, make a ./test/shopping-list-service.spec.js file that tests the CRUD methods.
